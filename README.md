# Yield Imputations

### Introduction:
-----------------
- The project explores a variety of techniques to impute missing values. 
- These experiments were conducted during an Internship for [Granular](www.granular.ag) with the goal of increasing the company's model predictions by filling in missing data.


### The Data:
-------------
- Data is queried from [NASS quick stats](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/) for two crops, Corn and Soybeans.
- Using a [python script](get_data.py) historical yield data is queried at the county level from 1970 - 2016. 
- Cleaning and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is conducted for both [CORN](corn_EDA.ipynb) and [SOYBEANS](soybeans.ipynb)

- As can be seen from the map and barchart above, complete data is spatialy correlated, and comprises less than a third of the dataset. 

- In this case, it is hard to imagine a scenario where you would need only 47 consecutive years of data and would settle for nothing less. However, if we generalize the problem to a dataset with 47 independent variables (columns) and 2768 samples (rows), a $2768\times47$ matrix, then we can approach it as any dataset that we would like to model. 
    - A majority of machine learning models/algorithms depend on complete data.
    - What methods can you think of off the top of your head to replace these values?

Heatmaps are a useful tool to visualize not only the range of values within datasets, but also to see where we have missing values.

Taking a closer look at Iowa, we notice their are only 4 missing values:

Alabama tells another story:

And California yet another:

At first glance the enitre dataset, doesn't look all that bad. Roughly a quarter of the data is missing.

However, this low estimate is quite deceiving. If our goal is to only include "full" data, i.e. samples with all 47 features (years in this case), then the true figure is a shocking. Considering only complete observations leads to an immense loss of information, â‰ˆ70% of this dataset.


### The Goal: 
-------------

Clearly, methods are required to impute these missing values. In this repository, imputation procedures are explored and analyzed. 

Methods include:
- Mean imputations
- Forward (and Backward) Filling 
- Linear Regression
- Spatial approaches
    - Weighted Distance Metrics
    - Exponentially Smoothed Kernels
    - k nearest neighbors algorithms
        - k averaged neighbors
        - radius
